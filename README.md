NYC-Accident-Predictor
This repository contains the project files for predicting the number of injuries in car accidents in New York City. The goal of this project was to leverage multiple data sources and machine learning techniques to build a model capable of estimating the number of injuries based on various features, including weather conditions.

Project Overview
The project involved the following steps:

Data Collection: Integrated data from three sources:
NYC Open Data
Weather API
Data Preparation: Created an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to clean and transform the datasets.
Feature Engineering: Merged datasets by date, performed data cleaning, and prepared the data for analysis.
Model Training: Experimented with different machine learning models, conducted hyperparameter tuning, and evaluated model performance.
